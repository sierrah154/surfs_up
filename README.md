Comparing the results found in the descriptive statistical analysis for June and December, we see a difference in mean temperature per month, where June is higher. June has a higher mean temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures. Since the difference in degrees Fahrenheit is only 8 degrees, the type of customer may not change throughout the year.
